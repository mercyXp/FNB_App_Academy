# Lesson 2: Setting up a Workspace

To start building your app, you’ll begin by **creating a workspace**.  
A workspace is where **all your files, folders, and code** for your app will be stored and managed.

## 🧰 Your Workspace Includes:

1. 📝 **A Text Editor**  
   Used to write and edit your code. (We'll use **VS Code**)

2. 🌐 **A Web Browser**  
   Used to **preview and test** your app in real-time (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

3. 📁 **A Folder**  
   A dedicated folder where all **project files and assets** will be saved

## 🧪 Sample HTML Structure

Here's the basic structure of an HTML document you'll use to get started:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
